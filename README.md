# Employee Directory

For this assignment I was tasked with creating an employee directory using React. User should be able to view the entire employee directory at once so that they can have quick access to every employee's information.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.
